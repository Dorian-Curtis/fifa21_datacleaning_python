# FIFA 21 DATA CLEANING

FIFA 21 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver and published by Electronic Arts.

For this project, we have used the fifa21_raw_data_V2.csv from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring?select=fifa21_raw_data.csv%E2%80%8B

In this small data cleaning project,we have done many tasks :

* Convert the height and weight datatypes to numerical forms

* Remove the unnecessary newline characters from all columns that have them

* Separate the joined column into year, month and day column

* Convert the Loan Date End column to datetime type

* Convert the 'Value', 'Wage' and "Release Clause' columns to numbers

* Convert the Hits column to integer

* Some columns have 'star' characters. Strip those columns of these stars and make the columns numerical
